## Overview
> The focus of this repository is not to create an application or develop an app, the real focus of this repository is to learn how to set up a project little by little.

#### The evolutions of the code will be separated by versions created by tags.

> Note.: For change tags run git command `git checkout TAG_NAME` ex.: `git checkout v0.2`

### Status
 - v0.1: Minimal code for run ReactJS without `create-react-app` using webpack and babel.
 - v0.2: First settings for `Typescript` and more configurations in `webpack` for support `css, scss, png, SVG, jpg, GIF, minification, optimizations` and more.
